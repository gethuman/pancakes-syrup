pancakes-syrup
==========

This library will essentially contain our interface to AWS, Rackspace and other cloud services.
There are a series of build tasks that can be added to your pancakes project so that you can deploy
to a cloud service provider.

**NOTE: Not ready for prime time**

It is January, 2015 and I am just starting to work on this. Should have it in place fairly quickly, though.
Check back in another month.

## Installation

From the command line enter:

```
npm install pancakes-syrup --save
```
